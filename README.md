# Arithmetic-Formatter
This is an arithmetic formatter for the freeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python certification.

You had to create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. 
For example:
Function Call:

arithmetic_arranger(["32 + 698", "3801 - 2", "45 + 43", "123 + 49"])
Output:

         32      3801      45      123
      + 698    -    2    + 43    +  49
      -----    ------    ----    -----
